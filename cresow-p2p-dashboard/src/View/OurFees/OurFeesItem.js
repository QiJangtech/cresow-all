                                - Normal Wallet Address â€“ Wallets such as prepared by Exqube, Metamask, Myether Wallet are standard wallets with no contract.<br/>
                                We will use the standard gas fee with 21,000 gas to send the transaction.<br/><br/>

                                Contractual Wallet Address.<br/>

                                Wallets from Exchanges like Binance, Bittrex, ICOs or others which are not mentioned would require a much higher gas fee and gas limit to send.<br/>
                                We will adjust the gas limit from time to time based on traffic.<br/><br/>

                                We strongly advice user to use non-contractual wallet address to lower the transaction fee which may occur.
